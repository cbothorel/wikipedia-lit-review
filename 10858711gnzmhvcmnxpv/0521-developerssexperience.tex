The situations and purposes for which the editors use Wikipedia seem
to be similar as for other users, according to \citeauthor{FranckeSundin10}'s
study (2010), based on the interviews of 11 Swedish Wikipedia editors.
However, they draw on their knowledge as members of the network of
practice of Wikipedians to make credibility assessments, including
knowledge of certain editors and of the MediaWiki architecture. Their
assessments have more similarities with those used in traditional
media than with assessments springing from the wisdom of crowds. Thus
being editors would give extra information on the encyclopedia and
make it being used more efficiently.

Regarding the impact of the quality process on editors' motivation,
\citet{HalfakerKitturRiedl11} showed that ''that reverts are powerfully
demotivating, but that their net influence is that more quality work
is done in Wikipedia as a result of reverts than is lost by chasing
editors away. However, {[}they{]} identify key conditions - most specifically
new editors being reverted by much more experienced editors - under
which reverts are particularly damaging.'' In addition to this, the
process of decision is viewed as ''bureaucratic'' by the editors
\citep{MullerSeitzReger10}. These two points can threaten the participation
in the long run as there is a link between contributors' enjoyment
and participation, as shown by \citet{Amichai-Hamburgeretal08}. \citet{LopesCarrico08},
doing an analysis of quality of the links, showed that the implementation
of template for internal links improved the quality of these links,
whereas this quality was not that good for external references. It
would be interesting to study if the fact that there is an asymmetry
between internal facility of use and external relationship management
difficulties is a more general characteristic of the MediaWiki tool,
and if improvements are needed or possible. More specific studies
exist, such as \citeauthor{Buzzietal08}'s on the way to improve the
easiness of editing for the blind (2008), which showed that several
problems remained in 2008, some of them not yet solved\footnote{See the page dedicated to this particular problem: \url{http://blind.wikia.com/wiki/Mediawiki_and_Accessibility}}.
