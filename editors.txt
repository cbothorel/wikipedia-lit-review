http://misq.org/butler-brian less good, as i know him. Could serve as a pre-reviewer

http://misq.org/chen-hsinchun research interest: design science, data mining, so maybe, but seems a bit far from the domain of application

http://misq.org/jarvenpaa-sirkka probably the best fit, "My primary research interests include behavioral and organizational research on digital innovation, inter-organizational collaborations, virtual teams, outsourcing, social media. I particularly value treatments that span levels of analysis and explore dynamics over time and contexts. I welcome papers that deploy qualitative and quantitative methods. My skills do not include large data sets, simulation, and analytical modeling. I particularly value research that examines novel phenomena and push theoretical boundaries (or merely applying existing theory from another field or context). "
