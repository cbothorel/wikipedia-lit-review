Being the core of the project, it is not surprising that this topic
is one of the first to have been studied. The studies can be split
in two, the firsts looking at the articles in general, the seconds
studying one specific kind of articles, the Feature Articles, which
are considered by the projects as the best articles (their intrinsic
quality is, however discussed \citep{Lindsey10}, and the arguments
of quality to qualify an article as Feature Article (FA) varies from
one language to another, according to \citet{Stviliaetal09}, two
points we will come back to in the last section). As for the precedent
sub-section, we will start from the studies looking at the global
structure of the project (and relying on statistical analyses of the
dump data, for most of them), toward the analyses of the edition of
article, finishing with some remarks on the dynamics of interaction
behind this process.
