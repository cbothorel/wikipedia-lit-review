%% We will scale this table to the page width using adjustbox. However, we want
%% columns to wrap instead of just shrinking, so we will give each column a portion
%% of the page width which together adds up to somewhat, but not much, over the
%% actual page width. This creates the need to enforce column space with @{}.
%% Because I don't want to abuse \midrule (a big no-no with booktabs), I increased
%% arraystretch to keep the wrapped rows from bleeding into one another.
